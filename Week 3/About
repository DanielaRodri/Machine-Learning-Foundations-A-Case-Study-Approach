How do you guess whether a person felt positively or negatively about an experience, just from a short review they wrote?
In our second case study, analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) 
from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).This task is an example of classification, 
one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting,
spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification.</p>You will analyze the accuracy of your classifier,
implement an actual classifier in a Jupyter notebook, and take a first stab at a core piece of the intelligent application 
you will build and deploy in your capstone.
