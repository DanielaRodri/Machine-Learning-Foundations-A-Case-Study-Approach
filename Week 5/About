Ever wonder how Amazon forms its personalized product recommendations? How Netflix suggests movies to watch? 
How Pandora selects the next song to stream? How Facebook or LinkedIn finds people you might connect with? 
Underlying all of these technologies for personalized content is something called collaborative filtering. 
You will learn how to build such a recommender system using a variety of techniques, and explore their tradeoffs.
One method we examine is matrix factorization, which learns features of users and products to form recommendations.
In a Jupyter notebook, you will use these techniques to build a real song recommender system.
