A reader is interested in a specific news article and you want to find a similar articles to recommend. 
What is the right notion of similarity? How do I automatically search over documents to find the one that is most similar?
How do I quantitatively represent the documents in the first place?. In this third case study, retrieving documents, 
you will examine various document representations and an algorithm to retrieve the most similar subset. You will also consider
structured representations of the documents that automatically group articles by similarity (e.g., document topic).
You will actually build an intelligent document retrieval system for Wikipedia entries in an Jupyter notebook.
