This week you will build your first intelligent application that makes predictions from data.
We will explore this idea within the context of our first case study, predicting house prices, 
where you will create models that predict a continuous value (price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).
This is just one of the many places where regression can be applied.Other applications range from predicting health outcomes in medicine,
stock prices in finance, and power usage in high-performance computing, to analyzing which regulators are important for gene expression.
You will also examine how to analyze the performance of your predictive model and implement regression in practice using a Jupyter notebook.
