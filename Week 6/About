Youâ€™ve probably heard that Deep Learning is making news across the world as one of the most promising techniques in machine learning.
Every industry is dedicating resources to unlock the deep learning potential, including for tasks such as image tagging, object recognition, 
speech recognition, and text analysis. In our final case study, searching for images, you will learn how layers of neural networks provide
very descriptive (non-linear) features that provide impressive performance in image classification and retrieval tasks. You will then construct
deep features, a transfer learning technique that allows you to use deep learning very easily, even when you have little data to train the model.
Using iPhython notebooks, you will build an image classifier and an intelligent image retrieval system with deep learning
